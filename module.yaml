name: gwem
version: 1.0

cite:
    - "arXiv:XXXX.XXXXXX"

assumptions:
    - "EM sources have a probability of association with the GW sources."
    - "Distances determined from the GW data marginalizing over all other astrophysical parameters."
    - "Redshifts are obtained from spectroscopy of the host galaxies."
    - "Peculiar velocity corrections are applied and treated as systematic uncertainties."

explanation: |
    "The era of multi-messenger cosmology started with the neutron star merger GW170817.
    We incorporate this new cosmological probe into the cosmosis framework. 
    The measurement is based on the distance-redshift relation.
