    - "Soares-Santos, Pereira and Garcia, arXiv:XXXX.XXXXXX"

assumptions:
    - "Electromagnetic counterpart identified for all events in the sample."
    - "Peculiar velocities are treatead as a systematic shift in the z measurements."
    - "Distances determined from the GW data marginalizing over all other parameters."

explanation: |
    "The era of multi-messenger cosmology started in 2017, with the neutron star merger GW170817.
    With a significant rate of events expected in 2018 and subsequent years, we were motivated to 
    incorporate this new cosmological probe into the framework used by DES and LSST DESC for 
    cosmological analyses. This module is the result of that effort.
